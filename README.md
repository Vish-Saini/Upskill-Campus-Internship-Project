🌾 Prediction of Agriculture Crop Production in India
📌 Internship Project @ Upskill Campus
🔍 Project Overview

Agriculture plays a vital role in India’s economy, contributing significantly to GDP and employment. However, crop production is highly dependent on multiple factors like rainfall, temperature, soil type, fertilizers, and irrigation facilities.

This project aims to predict agricultural crop production in India using data-driven machine learning models. By analyzing historical crop yield data along with climatic and soil parameters, we attempt to provide insights that can assist farmers, policymakers, and researchers in better planning and resource allocation.

🎯 Objectives

Collect and preprocess crop production data of India.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations.

Apply machine learning models for yield prediction.

Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics.

Build a framework to forecast production trends for major crops.

📂 Dataset

Features may include:

State / District

Crop Name

Area (in hectares)

Production (in tonnes)

Season (Kharif/Rabi/Zaid)

Rainfall, Temperature (if available)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas, numpy → Data preprocessing

matplotlib, seaborn → Visualization

scikit-learn → Machine Learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

🔧 Methodology

Data Collection – Gather historical crop production datasets.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize production trends across years, states, and crops.

Feature Engineering – Extract meaningful features like rainfall index, seasonality, etc.

Model Building – Train and test multiple ML models (Regression & Ensemble methods).

Model Evaluation – Compare models using metrics (R², RMSE, MAE).

Prediction – Forecast production for selected crops.

📊 Results

Identified seasonal patterns in crop production across states.

Random Forest Regressor provided the best prediction accuracy compared to Linear Regression.

The model can be extended to include weather forecasting data for improved accuracy.

🌟 Future Scope

Integrate real-time weather APIs for dynamic predictions.

Develop a web-based dashboard for farmers/policymakers.

Expand dataset with soil quality and irrigation data.

Apply Deep Learning models (e.g., LSTMs) for time-series forecasting.
